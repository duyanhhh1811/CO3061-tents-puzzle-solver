# [HCMUT] [CO3061] [Assignment 1]
An AI ('A' in this word means 'Algorithm') was built to solve [Tents-Puzzle Game] (https://www.puzzle-tents.com/)

## Start
To start this game, please type 
```python
python3 main.py
```
## Description
1. We support visualizing 2 graph searching algorithm: BFS (Blind Search) and A* (Heuristic Search)
2. Input: choose between 6 (matrix: 6x6) or 8 (matrix 8x8)
3. When the pygame window appears, click 'Next Testcase' button to gen next testcase (1-5: Easy, 6-10: Hard)
4. Then click 'AI Solver' to choose 1 of 2 searching method above
5. Then, when it solved successfully, you can view its solution by clicking 'Next State' button (we also provide 'Prev State' button)
6. When it is done, some attribute (execution time, total generated states) will be displayed on the screen, with 2 new button 'Quit' and 'Continue'
7. Click 'Quit' to exit, 'Continue' to continue playing with some another testcases
